High up above, I am not coming down
When you are lost my satellite song is out there

High up above, I am not coming down
When you are lost my satellite song's above
Take me up to the waving fields and leave me there
Buried by the hanging tree i never said flee from here
You never spooked me son
It's rising up to cast out my folded hands
Swinging low to the sweet and shunned
Where the broken bones come down easy

Glory held out, till it's rising up from our lips
Purged and devoured
Draws the trembling fits
Wake up honey it's long road that'll guide you down
To take the pills it's a short fix
That'll bring a coward strapped and stunned to an electric chair
Lighting up his blood as his woman stripped bare
On the swinging low of his brother's stairs
Where she lost her faith in dying

Oh i knew those saints were the first to scorn
Charging out of town, she's a fleeing whore
Galloping those fields like a dropping sun
Near the tree she fell where my gravestone was
Where you go I'll follow
Though I'm on the west coast
Keep swimming in the strange seas
You said as you flew back home

Your love is like some wrecking ball
Babe, your eyes, they're got me something terrible
You got on the phone and told, told everyone
That I've got it coming

I woke to some blue light
Pain flashing in my head
I knew you would see it
Yeah, I knew you would understand
That your love is like some wrecking ball
Babe, your eyes, they're got me something terrible
You jumped a plane and told, told everyone
That I've got it coming

Your love is like some wrecking ball
Babe, your eyes, they're got me something terrible
You jumped a plane and told, told everyone
That I've got it coming

Low glowing light of the fall
You stood in the bright of the hallway
I'll search through the ribbons and gold
To see where you go when you're lonely

I am gonna follow wherever you fly
Out into the darkness or the light
I will live forever but still it's not enough time
So I am gonna follow wherever you fly

I'm watching you fixing your dress
What colors will you spin in next
You shot through the plate of my chest
I'm riding the wild of all your steps

I wash my hands to erase all of the lines inside
I thought some of you had followed me out here
They were the kind that would follow me down into their demise
Where were they all before I came to rise?
I could control the colors of the night above me
I had a pain of love somewhere inside move through me

I could control the colors of the night above me
I had a pain of love somewhere inside move through me

What was my name?
How did I get here?
Somehow I've forgotten

All of the fires, they spread so fast by word of mouth
And the mouths with their tongues saying words that I already said

I could control the colors of the night above me
I had a pain of love somewhere inside move through me

I could control the colors of the night above me
I had a pain of love somewhere inside move through me

I could control the colors of the night above me

What was my name?
How did I get here?
What was my name?
I have forgotten
I will watch the sparrows swim into the stack
Here's where you will find me; never turning back

If you have it in you
Let it move across you, Heather
Twenty buildings pass you
You'll be like the birds

You will sleep in blood
Beds of rivers wrapped in dark red, Heather
Like them who line the fences
You'll be like the birds
Have you seen the houses charging in their bays?
Once they're drenched in moon days, we will fly to the graves

If you have it in you
Let it move across you, Heather
Twenty buildings pass you
You'll be like the birds

You will sleep in blood
Beds of rivers wrapped in dark red, Heather
Like them who line the fences
You'll be like the birds

Misted wake to the end of your healing
You're bathed in blue watch it birth from the ceiling
Now I write these words from the fever feeling
With the flying ships over chlorine dreaming
Hold it down

Chordal clouds in the clotted veins
Then make no moves when the hunger pangs
Shuffled steps to the sounds of the feeding tubes
All these things at the life of a new you, until they brought you down
Nobody here, nobody hеre knows
Nobody here, nobody hеre knows
They don't know nothing about the way you love
They don't know nothing about how great you are

You let the time run down
You leave your work clothes out
And take the red line only
Buried the rest of your money
Nobody followed you there
Or see you take the stairs
Just stayed back and twisted your words
Or tried to fix you first
Or focused in on your worst
Or rifled through your purse
And then they left the bill for an expensive plot
Until your legs gave out
And they called you lost

All in or cease, to preach to the wandering
Bare teeth must show them, they make all mistakes alone
You'll find that it's the season of killing
But the covering is thin
Still the cage in the corner
Has the coroner's keys in it
Born of a visionary
He stood back the length of his arms
Son of a whereabout land
Was purged in the afternoon sun
All rise in clause, don't let it touch you
Form back your feelings, cause it turns their stomachs ill

It's the season of killing
But the covering is thin
Still the cage in the corner
Has the coroner's keys in it
Case the tragical witness
To persuading his demons
And the woman he loved ran to the man that denied it

When I go to sleep, I see horses
And in those silver dreams, I hear voices
I won't be afraid, but I'm no miracle

Beautiful baby
So dies the young now
You know I got to ride

When I'm all alone, I see through mirrors
In the dead TV set, I see figures
Yeah, beautiful baby
So dies the young now
You know I got to ride

You know I got to ride

He had his whole life in front of him
But he couldn't sleep, no he couldn't sleep
So she had this dream of a canopy
With cosmical scenes, that's all that he needs

Then she told everyone
The things that she had done
How she had saved his life, yeah

But when they left him all alone
He got on the phone
And started telling everybody
And he said
He had this weird way of telling it
A colorful lie, that was what they all liked
But she had to clear up a little bit
So parts of it changed, still all of it strange

She took him to the place
That's spinning out in space
It was beauty, it was heartache

But he couldn't see the ground
So he started flipping out
And now he's telling everybody
And he said

She is all that he needs and it's right there in front of him

He had his whole life in front of him, yeah

I washed my hands to erase all the lines inside
I thought some of you had followed me out here
But they were the kind that would follow me down into their demise
But where were they all before I came to rise?

I could control the colors of the night
I had the pain of love somewhere inside
Move through me

I could control the colors of the night
Above me
I had the pain of love somewhere inside
Move through me
What was my name?
How did I get here?
Somehow, I've forgotten

All of the fires
They spread so fast by word of mouth
And the mouths were the tongues
Saying words that I already said

I could control the colors of the night
Above me
I had the pain of love somewhere inside

I could control the colors of the night
Above me
Move through me

I could control the colors of the night
Above me

What was my name?
How did I get here?
I have forgotten

Hun, he never arrived where you laid softly beside
His father would fall to his knees, his sister would cry
Burst oh drunken seams, glow your sins for these
Where those dooming waves are straying
You came to the wedding, but nothing seemed too right
Cause somewhere your heart was spinning leaves in the sand
And begging to follow the roads that will carry you home

Adorn the sinner in diamonds
Bring him down to the river to sleep
And sing chorals of late and weary tunes
Burst oh drunken seams, glow your sins for these
Where those dooming waves are straying
Shot up in glory
Galloping through day blooms
The shaking couldn't keep the spirits to form
Who sing those strange chorals and tunes that will carry you home

You came to the wedding but nothing seemed too right
Shot up in glory, galloping through day blooms

Couldn't tell you where i buried him
I knew there'd be questioning my happenstance
Why would you believe the one who left had a role to play in your deliverance?
With sweet instead

He buys the ring but this is unnecessary oh my baby
This is unnecessary

Heavy in your lungs the night before
Hoping weary songs were melodies of love
But shadows from the starlings in the trees
Are sweeping you to sleep the last and wishing luck
But it doesn't fit when he buys the ring
This is unnecessary oh my baby
This is unnecessary

You found a way to sing along and clap your hands with the rest of us
But i saw you in the dark, you were clawing at the walls
Shake it from your fears

Son, tragically wound you curse the stairs
That suddenly turned you unaware
Wandering eyes will tell you this:
Truth will be told, i'll bury you

Your feeling this, the judge has dug his nails in it
Now damned to die
The fireworks carry on as i signed the deal to sing along
It's easier if you let it be, don't fight it off, you're struggling
Let them bring you the chair, it's calling you to fry

At the back of the world there's a set of stairs
They rise to the back of a perfect place

So climb those stairs and jump
Hold your heart and hold your gun
Hold your breath you'll be someone
If your eyes don't overrun
The sounds of someone's stammered tongue, you've fallen

Watch your hands shake, wash their feet
Tell the world you love the meek
Yet pretty eyes you always seek

And then they say that grace is fear, you're the one who needs it
They lift you up, they set you on the alter and they creep
In the shape of melodies that echo in the night
In the way you give your tired body to the heights
And in all the little place hidden in your life, they all surround you

Down the flyers, drink their blood
Drive the roads and bring the floods
Floating up flight sideways arc
A moments spied down on the park

And all that they could ever want is there upon the road
A bruised and broken memory so they can feel alone
Keep it in the corner of your mind, and let it sleep
The markers in the water, burning red, the side peripheries
At the time it's funny how you can't recall the times it wasn't ever beautiful

Down into the gauze and through the seams he let it in
He paid it no attention cause her eyes were never ending
And a lie a person tells to wake a beauty
Is a war between the heart and terrible truth

Old man walking, trying to find his way back through
To a young man talking, reaching out his hand to you
Hold me closer, watch until the sun turns blue
Then I'll be an old man walking, trying to find his way back through
Trace the outer edges of a coaster nobody sees
Little miracles into the crystal are all you need
And the place into the past you're engineering
Can't work without the life already had
When this begins, it's turning blue
The birds fly south
Up inside the higher, you sing a new song
It says, "Slow down."

I go walking in the night
I'm out in the twilight blue
And down into moonlight rooms
I'm passing through

I go walking in the night
When all of the people sleep
But none of the sleepers dream
When I'm moving through
I go walking in the night
I go walking in the night

Someone's in the fire escapes
Someone's in the hallway
But most are in their bedrooms

And everyone was all-consumed
So look into the double lens
And talk into the camera
And say "This is how their story ends."

I go walking in the night
I'm out in the twilight blue
And down into moonlight rooms
I'm passing through

I go walking in the night
When all of the people sleep
But none of the sleepers dream
When I'm moving through

I go walking in the night
I go walking in the night

I go walking in the night
I go walking in the night
Over the window now
Maybe it was all the ways of dreams, and electric things
Walking with you outside
Pointing to trails in the midnight sky
Me with my anxious eyes
You'd say, "You're going to find that girl, you're going to love those babies. It's going to weigh you down, but it's the place you're found in."

Because all at once all your life in this life will open wide
And turn your ever horizon
And at the heart of the broken you'll find your place in the kingdom
Into the arrow lands
Covered in dust with all these plans, no place to land
Watching thе time run down
Or watching the time movе up to speed, like hide and seek
Until I heard the news, and I walked on through
And all the walls covered in flowers -- the only lights are candles now

And all at once all the eyes in this place look away
Oh and down at the poison
And look he spins in the corner
Beautiful fate in reorder

I wish I could've called you
I wish I could've turned all the lights in the world on
And now I'm over the window
And now I guess I'll walk the whole damn way back alone

You felt some booming inside your heart
So you wandered further than we all thought

You can't remember how long it has been since home
Or how tired your eyes have grown
But you know now it's grace that you've got

You are a wayfarer's daughter, hon
You've got some wild inside your heart

And you're lost, dear how long has it been since home?
You don't care that you're all alone
'Cause you know now it's grace that you've got
And you shimmer like dust rising from the floor
In the house where your kids were born
It's alright, 'cause it's grace that you've got
One by one the little children gunned him down to the ditch near the road
While the drums marching on never stop, never let
Laugh for now little darling cause the devil has drawn out the lines
A hymn too late where the earth goes when winter arrives

Stop your luck love it's begging contradiction
And turning your head

To see skin so fair
It's pulling the lonely in oh no!
And chasing a light to jagged stones
Lying below the sea, calling you home beneath
As your body departs
I just walked around this island
And not a rumor of one left the cash
While the workhorse machine never stops never lets

You're in a rush love and it's so full of envy
It's cursing our steps
I spent the whole night
Digging a hole inside my living room
I used a bright light
To echo stars in pools of shivered moonlight

I'm falling further and further than I thought I would be, yeah
I bought some time so you wouldn't believe that I lost my own mind

But to you my honey see, I've wasted time
I thought you'd love me if you were mine
But you demand that boring life you have with him now
I spent my whole life
Looking at lights through tilted chandeliers
I made devices
That tunneled colors you were born to hear

I'm falling further and further than I thought I would be, yeah
I bought some time so you wouldn't believe that I lost my own mind

But to you my honey see, I've wasted time
I thought you'd love me if you were mine
But you demand that boring life you have with him now

Yeah out upon the scene they took my life
They've got their reasons and younger wives
They'll understand that boring life they have once I'm gone

I spent my whole life looking at lights through tilted chandeliers
