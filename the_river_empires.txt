The ships to lull, I rose from curving shores in silence to ail
The morning town, with cosmic rivers spilling secrets of murder

I chase the tracks now, it's cutting curving through the cursors of trees
I cannot sleep, blossom in loom has left me restless to keep still

"What strange leads, and why is this in slant?", I heard them speak
"We have found his trace!"

Panicking, my heart beats so loud, it's spinning and arching up
The dogs are barking and echoing the oaks
The Western Shore
A homeless man with homeless purpose comes home

Japanese Moon
Those galley flags and eerie waters are gone

The Moonless Eve
With outlined matted grass a man lay alone

The hounds have followed a scent

Your glowing skin has left my looming lips
They’re pacing like a war
Honey don’t you see you are coughing up the stars?
A covetous for marching with a rope
To lunar finding lines
Causing you to choke a molecule to life

Under moonlight, there’s a dance atop the graves
Be so afraid, for it steps into our sleep
Underwater, we have leapt beyond the shore
Sweeping out to the bones upon the floor
A poison tongue will lift you to the plaints
It’s bowing head will turn
The fairest of the screams as it plunges in your heelYou might also likeEmbed
Swimming the grass with tall and elegant strokes
Through blossoming seas, then I pulled you under
Hounds of the glades sound resonating bells
To follow to the caves where something is hiding

Cupping your hands in full, the gearing blades are dull
And sting when they are cold, but you’ll never fix it
I couldn’t help that I was watching with a thrill
Oh the loveliness I feel when I see you drowning

How were you choked against the tree?
How was the last suffering scream?
Please leave me still I’m loosing sleep
You’re right at the bedpost floating to meYou might also likeEmbed
Fixed in her hands there’s a trembling fear
She’s sailing to dimmer mars with nervous gears
She is full with a marching of clocks
Ticking discovery through the gate
Now on the lawn she spilled like infinity
Floating along on her bright olive skin
I felt the lost in the braille on her lips
It’s reading the surfacing breath

Lovely seconds with her drift from me
The hooded in watchful gaze
Now she has left here
Place here with proxies to pale English rose
Lower her gently down on the stairs
In the borders of deepening earth you have been creeping there
Buried oars
Bitter froth wine her mother’s tears drip
Severed young servants will sift past her lips
Poised in the stars are the stirrings of fools cresting the inward hillsYou might also likeEmbed
In the vineyard there's two young lovers in the bright, making their plans
"Bring your family under dad's backyard and strings of light
We'll dance, and everyone to view!"
Spinning in the lace, choral of the shouts, lips in hallowed safe
To colors of the trails that both of them will take
Untying of the barge, as they wave away
Mother turns to say, "What a grand escape!"

She's a lover and he forged a home under the trees
They felt alive
Bless the woman when she gave birth to a lovely babe
She smiled, as he stood amazed
"What a burst of stars and fate to intertwine a child's purest life
If we start to bless, woman can't you see?
This baby has a chance beyond the solar cold
To start a cleaner slate, what a grand escape!"
One night happened where the wall fell bending up the floor
The flood to drown
They were sleeping as the tall shelf crashed over the man, it pinned him down
She rose panicked and tried to pull her husband free, the water at her waist
He said, "Honey, leave me and go and grab the babe!"
She got the child, but won't make it too safe
She looked out at the trees, there was only one last chance
Maybel, she now comes, creeping on the waves
Calling from the porch, In which she turned her face
"I dread the thing you are but the hour it is now!
You need to save my baby, I gotta get my husband out!"
The witch's eyes lit up and spun away in greed
It's uneasy to entrust a child to the grave
As the witch fled on her way, the evergreens in sway
What a grand escape!You might also likeEmbed
She sighs, breaching a birth that will send her ill
Township sings of the swift apple blossom year
To reach out swim toward some spinning bled in strange she moves too

Up rise in bended light
Dance the streets of gloom to sedate
Cast our seeds

Compass tilts like a war over Coventry
His wife stirs, orbiting up past the marble sea
Brake two needles that bruise the veins
Oar resounds that she moves
Up rise in bended light
Dance the streets of gloom to sedate
Cast our seeds onto the rocks
And pray our graves will welcome usYou might also likeEmbed
A pattern was on your hem
And I got vexed by the spell of the way it was drawing
As you hung on the branch in the field where we found you

I forget that I’m still here
Cause in the bed where I wake there’s a bird near the window
And it sings me to sleep as I leave from the drivewayYou might also likeEmbed

An inquisition to toss you in your sleep:
My lovely I could see your feigns from here
I took my wallet but I meant to leave my keys
I cursed the wooden panels creaking screams

Oh, and you said, "There's buried gold
And the tigers wait for us!"
Now the summer grass will move here
As they lick their chops for blood

I left the beach house and I saw a thousand lights
A part of every shell that weathered waves
The moon in labor as it birthed a silver Earth
And all the while warring nervous saintsYou might also likeEmbed
