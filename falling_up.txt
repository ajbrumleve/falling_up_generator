You're on your own now
Dressed in armour
If you run faster you'll forget

They walked along the walls
It was strange enough just to cause an itch
To lie right through my teeth
Except for my situation
My love, I saw your war
In the casting call
On the way to Forum A
And dazzled flies and flying lines
I know you never left the room, I know you
You're on your own now
Dressed in armour
If you run faster you'll forget

The strayers bite their tongues
Cause they feel the tingling violence in their lungs
But I was forced to speak, proclaiming Golden shapes
They hissed out the window, the finger princed a royal colour
Then I heard several gasps: "tell him to slither out!"

Down, down down
Where are the stirrings of old?
I knew you had to last

Your on your own now
Dressed in armour
If you run faster you'll forget

How strange that our character is running from
The very people who sent him away...
It must be those that walk on the walls, those wall
Walkers put on a sick and frightful display...You might also likeEmbed

I cut my ties at the end of a catatonic
When I woke up shaking like a blaze
At first my heart it beat like a helicopter
But soon it blurred like the lights on the freeway


It bloomed like an open wound
Like an open wound


Now walk the Earth

All it takes is a golden angle
Or a golden head of an arrowed light
'Cause an arrow points to a lie that they spoke
And a new angle is great in a fight


Blooms from an open wound

Float by open windows, what a shipwreck, what a shipwreck
Circles running through my veins, with the vates set, with the vates set

See the lines, see the lines
I start feeling
When I'm lost, when I'm lost
There's no meaning
Call it this, call it this
Spinning sideways and never stops

Lines in the sky calling me out, calling me out
Constant collide, calling me out, calling me out
Float by open windows, what a shipwreck, what a shipwreck
Glass flies all around me, now my veins let, now my veins let

Legacy will never burn
Hard to breathe, I'll never learn
And it moves me towards where I want to leave
In the silence we all speak
Laying down and suffering
Yet I move nothing and
Embrace what I don't need


So I stand, all alone
With your trance, on my own
Will I just sustain moving on in vain
'Cause this glow, you and I
Have come to know, is a lie
And we must move on

I can see past these fine lines that you stepped through
I can see through these glass eyes that led me on
I'm in this room, you're in that and you play hearts like instruments
I can see past these fine lines that you stepped through

Listen deep, You'll hear that sound
Whispering, it's all around
Echoes grasping in, Echoes lasting sin
Out of this, please open up
Move from this, it's taken us
And I need to change, and I need to say


So I stand, all alone
With your trance, on my own
Will I just sustain, moving on in vain

You can see I am in shock
To catch you wearing wires underneath your heart
It was mechanical
But we were born to endless architecture
Spinning to a fault and infinitely strewn

Tracing lines your flaws connect the starry skies
He is tracing lines like flashes right before your eyes
Grace comes like a thief in the night
It comes like a thief in the night
It blooms in the weak and the blind
Then they finished their machine

Run back toward home
Cover the windows
The screaming wind
The swinging hinge

They're riding away, stirring up dust in the light
They found a place with none of us
But the first thing she said sounded peculiar and strained
Like she couldn't believe the words that were shaping the outer lines

Just then the walls opened, just as they promised not to flee
Their plans were turned around and all the little cuts will bleed


Then they ran through the room, panic was blazing in blue
Like the blue from the lights came through as they flew past the overturned chairs
And then she leapt above, a silhouette hallowed in light
Night light shimmering dust that followed when all of the red beams turned at him
Father, where have you gone?
Mother, what have I done?

She said I swallowed keys, what have you done to keep us in the dark?
Now they're breaking through and I don't think that we can hold them off
All these lies, I'm losing count and my head is spinning
Let's close our eyes and count slow, and all of this will soon be gone


Then they ran through the room, panic was blazing in blue
Like the blue from the lights came through as they flew past the overturned chairs

Called on the phone a tracing line that ran through you and back to me
I can't believe your nerves to think that I was in the room
Known found and framed love
I dreamt that I had chopped the hands that fed
Colby hold your breath, it's quick, now good luck...

So slip the night
So start the race, your nameless place is gone
I know it's only flight


I can feel this burning close
I can feel this sinking in
Can you feel this moving in?
So, I say

While you're sleeping
You know I have escaped
While you're sleeping
You know I've been erased


Feel this now
The healing starts the motion floods your hope
Alone, you're moving past your home
So lift your thoughts
You're letting go of all you used to know
And now his blood will flow

Then they call you daughter, then they hypnotize you
Then they fall like lightning out across your bedroom walls

So pass the poison and hear those voices
And they're all calling my name

Take shelter now into the underground
Lie on the wooden floors in the dark
And hold your breath, reach for their hands you left
Reach for their hands, somehow reach for their hands

It's your son and daughter, and your daughter's fate

Small and sleeping children's song

Your golden arrows sing

I'll format your lips."

With the armour at my side

Born to the earth

And fell in spells of neon futures

And see them walk beneath you, see them walk beneath the ives
All of us, all of us, all of us, we'll take shelter now
All of us, all of us, all of us, we've lost ourselves

And found here behind the wall, someone left it on
Surrounded sorrow in breach, it severed the phones
Oh no! The line placed in the siding
Will find out where we're hiding
Protect the kids, they've come inside...

All of us, all of us, all of us, we'll take shelter now
All of us, all of us, all of us, we've lost ourselves

Come down from up above, you, down the drainpipe you will slide
And see them walk beneath you, see them walk beneath the ives

All of us, all of us, all of us, we'll take shelter now
All of us, all of us, all of us, we've lost ourselves

All of us, all of us, all of us, we'll take shelter now
All of us, all of us, all of us, we've lost ourselvesYou might also likeEmbed
